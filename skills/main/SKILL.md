<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If there is even a 1% chance a skill applies to your task, you MUST invoke it. No exceptions, no rationalizations.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you -- follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

When multiple skills could apply: process skills first (brainstorming, debugging), then implementation skills (executing-plans, tdd).

If you're thinking "this doesn't need a skill" — it probably does. Check BEFORE any action.

## Planning Context

When starting a complex task (multi-step, research, >5 tool calls):

1. Check if `.planning/` directory exists in the project root
2. If NOT found, run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/init-planning-dir.sh` to initialize it
3. If FOUND, read the existing planning files to recover context (see Session Recovery below)

The `.planning/` directory is your "RAM on disk" -- persistent working memory that survives context resets.

## Session Recovery

On session start, check for an existing `.planning/` directory. If found:

1. Read `.planning/progress.md` -- Task Status Dashboard shows current status; session log shows what was done
2. Read `.planning/findings.md` -- recall discoveries and decisions
3. Run `git diff --stat` to see what changed since last session
4. Update planning files with recovered context
5. Continue with the task

## Planning Approach Routing

When facing a non-trivial task (multi-step, architectural decisions, multi-file changes), do NOT automatically call `EnterPlanMode` or invoke `brainstorming`. Instead, present the choice to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

**Option 1: Quick Planning (Plan Mode)** — Lightweight read-only exploration. Best for medium-scope tasks with known approach, quick alignment before implementation.

**Option 2: Structured Brainstorming** — Full brainstorming pipeline with design doc, spec interview, implementation plan. Best for complex features, creative design decisions, multi-file refactors.

**When to skip this choice:**
- Trivial tasks (typo, single-line fix) → just do it, no planning needed
- User explicitly requests one mode (e.g., "let's brainstorm", "/plan") → use what they asked for
- Already inside plan mode or brainstorming → continue the current flow

**After Plan Mode completes:** If the approved plan reveals complex work (3+ tasks, multiple files), suggest transitioning to brainstorming/writing-plans for a formal implementation plan. Plan mode output can inform writing-plans — reference it, don't re-derive.

## Execution Routing

When the user requests plan execution (e.g., "execute the plan", "implement it", "start building"), do NOT directly invoke a single execution skill. Instead:

1. If no plan exists at `docs/plans/*-implementation.md`, invoke `superpower-planning:writing-plans` first.
2. If a plan exists, present the execution strategy choice via `AskUserQuestion`:
   - **Subagent-Driven** (this session, sequential) → `superpower-planning:subagent-driven`
   - **Team-Driven** (this session, parallel) → `superpower-planning:team-driven`
   - **Parallel Session** (separate session) → `superpower-planning:executing-plans`
3. Recommend based on: high parallelism + heavy tasks → Team-Driven; light serial → Subagent-Driven; manual checkpoints → Parallel Session.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `superpower-planning:planning-foundation` | Persistent file-based planning with .planning/ directory. Foundation layer inherited by all other skills. |
| `superpower-planning:brainstorming` | Structured brainstorming before implementation. Think before you code. |
| `superpower-planning:spec-interview` | Refine design docs through systematic deep questioning. Auto-invoked after brainstorming. |
| `superpower-planning:writing-plans` | Write detailed implementation plans with phases and checkpoints. |
| `superpower-planning:executing-plans` | Execute plans in a **separate session** with batch execution and human checkpoints. One of 3 execution strategies — see Execution Routing. |
| `superpower-planning:subagent-driven` | Execute plans in **this session, sequentially** via fresh subagents with two-stage review. One of 3 execution strategies — see Execution Routing. |
| `superpower-planning:team-driven` | Execute plans in **this session, in parallel** via Agent Team with dedicated reviewer. One of 3 execution strategies — see Execution Routing. |
| `superpower-planning:parallel-agents` | Run multiple subagents in parallel for independent tasks. |
| `superpower-planning:tdd` | Test-driven development: write tests first, then make them pass. |
| `superpower-planning:debugging` | Systematic debugging: reproduce, isolate, fix, verify. |
| `superpower-planning:git-worktrees` | Use git worktrees for parallel branch work without stashing. |
| `superpower-planning:finishing-branch` | Clean up and finalize a development branch before merge/PR. |
| `superpower-planning:archiving` | Archive completed plans, consolidate memory, and reset .planning/ for the next task. |
| `superpower-planning:requesting-review` | Prepare and submit code for review with context and rationale. |
| `superpower-planning:receiving-review` | Process review feedback systematically and address all comments. |
| `superpower-planning:verification` | Verify work is complete and correct before declaring done. |
| `superpower-planning:releasing` | Bump versions, tag, and publish GitHub Releases with changelogs. |
| `superpower-planning:writing-skills` | Create new skills for this plugin following the skill format. |

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
